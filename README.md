This repository uses **EM&bull;Scope** to benchmark **BlueJoule** &ndash; a representative **Bluetooth Low Energy** [BLE] application executing on a wide-range of HW/SW platforms.&thinsp; Visit the [em-foundation/emscope](https://github.com/em-foundation/emscope/blob/main/README.md) project to learn more about the **EM&bull;Scope** tool itself.

## Application

Repetitve advertising remains a fundamental capability of any Bluetooth Low Energy application.&thinsp; Because of its inherent simplicity, programs illustrating the [BLE broadcaster role](https://novelbits.io/bluetooth-low-energy-advertisements-part-1/) often serve as the "Hello World" within this space.

The **BlueJoule** benchmark will broadcast the same packet on the three standard BLE advertising channels.&thinsp; These transmissions occur back-to-back within a single _advertising event_; and these events will unfold at a 1&thinsp;s _advertising interval_. 

To faciliate "apples-to-apples" comparisons among different platforms, we require the underlying BLE radio to transmit packets at 0&thinsp;dB.&thinsp; A differentiator for HW vendors, TX power consumption in `mW` will often headline their datasheets.

And finally, the advertising packet itself comprises 19 bytes of payload defined with the following BLE data types:

| Len | Type | Data (hex)                                   | Notes                                         |
|----:|-----:|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `02`  |  `01`  | `06`                                     | Flags &mdash; LE General Disc + BR/EDR not supported      |
| `0A`  |  `08`  | `42 6C 75 65 4A 6F 75 6C 65`             | Local Name &mdash; `"BlueJoule"`             |
| `04`  |  `FF`  | `D3 08 FF`                               | Manufacturer &mdash; Company:&thinsp; [Novel Bits](https://novelbits.io/) (`0x08D3`),&thinsp; Data: `0xFF`&emsp; |

When _not_ actively advertising &ndash; over 99% of the time, in fact, within a 1&thinsp;s event cycle &ndash; we presume that the application has entered some "deep-sleep" mode to minimize power consumption.

## Catalog

This repository houses the following curated **EM&bull;Scope** capture directories &ndash; each initially populated using the `emscope grab` command with either its `-J, --js220` or `-P, --ppk2` option:

An `ABOUT.md` file found in each directory describes the capture's HW/SW configuration as well as summarizes its benchmark scores.

## Scores

We've compiled a pair of **EM&bull;erald** scores for each capture, assuming a 1&thinsp;s and 10&thinsp;s event cycle in each case.&thinsp; We've also awarded Gold&thinsp;ðŸ¥‡, Silver&thinsp;ðŸ¥ˆ, and Bronze&thinsp;ðŸ¥‰ medals when merited.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because of their different signal acquisition and power analysis capabilities, we've presented the **Joulescope JS220** and **Nordic PPK2** scores separately.&thinsp; While results generally seem consistent, anomalies can sometimes occur.

## Contributing

To contribute new captures (or to refine existing captures), fork this repository and then submit a pull request (PR) for our consideration.&thinsp; Needless to say, we presume prior experience with the [`emscope`](https://github.com/em-foundation/emscope) command-line tool.

> [!TIP]
> Use this command sequence when locally cloning your fork of this repo:
>
>```
> $ GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 git clone --filter=blob:none https://github.com/<USER-NAME>/<FORKED-REPO-NAME>
> $ cd <FORKED-REPO-NAME>
> $ git lfs install --local --skip-smudge
>```
>From here, you can use `emscope pack -u` to deflate `emscope-capture.zip` files locally as needed.

If you plan to submit a new capture, create a directory whose name follows the labeling conventions used throughout this repo.&thinsp; Copy an existing capture's `ABOUT.md` file into your new directory, and then modify this file's contents accordingly.
